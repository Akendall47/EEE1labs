## Section 7 - Control

Write code to drive your EEEBug towards a light source.
You will need to add the motor drive circuit from [Section 5](section5.md) to move the EEEbug forward.
Use the results of your light measurement to set the speed of each motor according to the direction of the light.
Control the motors with the with the `analogWrite()` function on pins 9 and 10.

	
- [ ] Develop code to make an effective light-seeking robot
		
*Advanced:* Sweeping the antennae from side to side can increase the functionality of your light measurement, since you can find the direction where the light level is brightest.
Using your servo motor control code from [Section 5](section5.md), devise a method of finding the maximum light level as your antennae move and record the angle.
			
- [ ] Use antennae motion to find the direction of the light source more accurately.
